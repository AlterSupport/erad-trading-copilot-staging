Product Scope Document: Agentic Fintech (Project X)
1. Introduction & Vision
This document outlines the product scope for Project X, a specialized AI advisory platform designed to serve as an intelligent co-pilot for Erad Partners. The application's core function is to provide personalized, context-aware trade guidance.
Users achieve this by securely uploading their trading history (blotter), which the AI agent uses as a foundational context to analyze their strategy, risk exposure, and positions. It then synthesizes this personal context with real-time market data and global events to deliver strictly advisory insights through an interactive, conversational interface.
This product is a custom solution developed exclusively for Erad Partners and is intended for use solely by its executives.
2. Central Offering: The Personalized AI Trade Advisor
The entire application is centered around a sophisticated advisory loop. The user provides their data, and the AI provides tailored analysis. This process is the primary feature and value proposition.
* Step 1: Contextualization via Blotter Upload
   * The user's journey begins by uploading a trade blotter (a standard CSV or file-based record of their trades, positions, and history).
   * Security and privacy are paramount. All uploaded data will be encrypted both in transit and at rest, and handled with strict confidentiality.
* Step 2: AI-Powered Portfolio & Strategy Analysis
   * Once uploaded, the AI agent parses the blotter to build a deep, private understanding of the user's trading profile. This includes:
      * Position Analysis: Identifying current holdings, asset concentration, and sector exposure.
      * Trading Style: Recognizing patterns like holding duration, frequency of trades, and preferred asset types (e.g., equities, crypto, commodities).
      * Risk Profile: Analyzing historical volatility, drawdown, and win/loss ratios to infer a risk tolerance.
* Step 3: Proactive, Context-Aware Guidance
   * The AI agent continuously cross-references the user's analyzed profile with real-time external data (global news, market trends, economic reports).
   * It then generates highly personalized insights. For example:
      * "Alert: New sanctions on Country Y were just announced, which may impact your significant holding in XYZ energy stock."
      * "Insight: Given your portfolio's high concentration in the tech sector, you should be aware of the upcoming semiconductor industry report on Friday."
      * "Observation: Your recent trades show a trend of selling winners too early. Let's analyze the potential upside you've missed."
* Step 4: Conversational Deep-Dive & Exploration
   * Users can engage with the AI in a natural language conversation to explore their profile and the market. They can ask complex, contextual questions that are impossible to ask generic search engines:
      * "How would a 2% rise in interest rates likely affect my current bond holdings?"
      * "Based on my blotter, what are my top three portfolio risks right now?"
      * "Summarize any news from the last 24 hours that is relevant to my open positions."
3. Supporting Application Features
All other features are built to support the core advisory function.
* Secure User & Account Management: Standard, secure user registration, login, and profile management.
* Advisory Dashboard: A central hub that provides a high-level summary of the AI's analysis, including key portfolio exposures, a watchlist of critical upcoming events, and a feed of the latest high-priority alerts.
* Blotter Management: An interface for users to upload new blotters, view a history of their uploads, and securely delete their data from the platform at any time.
4. Technical Architecture
The platform will be architected as a decoupled client-server web application, designed for security and the intensive data processing required for the AI analysis.
* Frontend Web Application (Client-Side): A responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) that provides the entire user experience, including the secure file upload interface and the conversational chat window.
* Backend Services (Server-Side): The secure backend will handle all heavy lifting: parsing uploaded blotters, running analysis routines, managing the AI core, integrating with market data APIs, and generating insights to be sent to the user.
5. Key Technologies
The technology stack is selected to enable a secure, performant, and intelligent advisory service.
* Frontend: Next.js (React), Zustand, Tailwind CSS, and Socket.IO.
* Backend: Python & FastAPI, with a Modular NLU & AI Core initially powered by Google Gemini Pro but designed to be model-agnostic.
* Database & Caching: PostgreSQL for structured data and Redis for caching.
* Deployment & Infrastructure: Docker on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leveraging services like Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, and secure connections to Vertex AI.
6. Scope of Work
* Primary Scope:
   * Development of the secure blotter upload and parsing engine.
   * Implementation of the AI analysis routines for portfolio and strategy assessment.
   * Integration with the LLM (Gemini) to generate conversational insights and alerts.
   * Building the core conversational user interface.
* Secondary Scope:
   * Development of the Advisory Dashboard.
   * Implementation of user account and blotter management features.
