# Agentic AI Implementation Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan to enhance the existing AI chat interface with agentic capabilities, including web search, blotter parsing, real-time asset pricing, and a deployable LLM service on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This will transform the current chat interface into a sophisticated financial advisory system.

## 2. Agentic AI Chat Architecture

The agentic AI will be built on a modular architecture that allows for the integration of various tools and services. The core of the agent will be an LLM that can reason and delegate tasks to specialized tools.

### 2.1. Core Components

- **LLM Core**: The central component of the agent, responsible for understanding user queries, planning tasks, and generating responses.
- **Tool Registry**: A registry of available tools that the agent can use to perform specific tasks.
- **Task Orchestrator**: A component that manages the execution of tasks and the flow of data between the LLM and the tools.

### 2.2. Tools

The agent will have access to the following tools:

- **Web Search Tool**: To search the web for real-time information.
- **Blotter Parser Tool**: To parse and analyze uploaded blotter files.
- **Asset Price Tool**: To fetch real-time asset prices.
- **Market Sentiment Tool**: To analyze market sentiment.

## 3. Web Search Integration

The web search tool will allow the agent to access real-time information from the internet. This will be crucial for providing up-to-date market analysis and news.

### 3.1. Implementation

- **API Integration**: We will use a third-party search API (e.g., Google Search API, Bing Search API) to perform web searches.
- **Data Extraction**: The agent will be able to extract relevant information from web pages, such as news articles, market data, and financial reports.

## 4. Blotter Parsing and Analysis

The blotter parser tool will enable the agent to understand the user's trading history and portfolio. This will be essential for providing personalized advice.

### 4.1. Implementation

- **File Parsing**: The tool will be able to parse various blotter formats (e.g., CSV, XLSX, JSON).
- **Data Analysis**: The tool will analyze the parsed data to identify key metrics, such as portfolio composition, risk exposure, and trading performance.

## 5. Real-time Asset Pricing

The asset price tool will provide the agent with real-time price data for various assets, including stocks, bonds, and commodities.

### 5.1. Implementation

- **API Integration**: We will use a financial data API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) to fetch real-time asset prices.
- **Data Caching**: We will use a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.

## 6. GCP Cloud Function Architecture

The LLM service will be deployed as a separate cloud function on GCP. This will allow for a scalable and cost-effective solution.

### 6.1. Architecture

- **Cloud Function**: The LLM service will be deployed as a Python-based cloud function.
- **API Gateway**: An API gateway will be used to expose the cloud function as a REST API.
- **Authentication**: The API will be secured using API keys or OAuth 2.0.

## 7. LLM Service Deployment Strategy

The LLM service will be deployed using a CI/CD pipeline to ensure a smooth and automated deployment process.

### 7.1. Deployment Pipeline

- **Source Control**: The source code for the LLM service will be stored in a Git repository.
- **Continuous Integration**: A CI server (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) will be used to build and test the code.
- **Continuous Deployment**: A CD server (e.g., Spinnaker, Argo CD) will be used to deploy the code to GCP.

## 8. Market Sentiment Analysis

The market sentiment tool will allow the agent to analyze the sentiment of news articles and social media posts. This will provide valuable insights into market trends and investor sentiment.

### 8.1. Implementation

- **NLP Models**: We will use pre-trained NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to perform sentiment analysis.
- **Data Sources**: We will use various data sources, such as news APIs and social media APIs, to gather data for sentiment analysis.

## 9. Implementation Timeline and Phases

The implementation will be divided into the following phases:

- **Phase 1: Core Agent and Web Search (2 weeks)**
  - Implement the core agent architecture.
  - Integrate the web search tool.
- **Phase 2: Blotter Parsing and Asset Pricing (3 weeks)**
  - Implement the blotter parser tool.
  - Integrate the asset price tool.
- **Phase 3: LLM Service and Market Sentiment (4 weeks)**
  - Deploy the LLM service on GCP.
  - Implement the market sentiment tool.
- **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (2 weeks)**
  - Perform end-to-end testing.
  - Deploy the application to production.
